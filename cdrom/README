# Junta source code (CD-ROM)
This CD-ROM includes the source code and a collection of games
implemented in Junta. Included are the following packages:

  - GAL: Game Abstraction Layer
  - IJunta: An interactive console interface to the scanner, parser, and
    interpreter
  - Interpreter: The actual interpreter. Creates and evaluates values
    based on AST, fed AST
  - Parser: The parser, creates AST, fed tokens
  - Scanner: The scanner, fed an input stream, creates a token stream
  - ScopeChecker: The scope checker, checks and modifies the AST, fed AST
  - Simulator: GUI building on top of GAL, fed a file
  - Utilities: Includes various classes used by other projects.

To play with Junta, run the Interactive class in the IJunta package or the Simulator class in the Simulator package.

When running the simulator, run with the VM options:
  - For OS X: -Djava.library.path=lib/lwjgl-2.9.1/native/macosx
  - For Windows: -Djava.library.path=lib/lwjgl-2.9.1/native/windows
  - For Linux: -Djava.library.path=lib/lwjgl-2.9.1/native/linux

And supply it with a program argument, such as:
  - games/ice/ice.junta

An example of such a call is:
  - java -jar Simulator.jar
      -Djava.library.path=lib/lwjgl-2.9.1/native/linux
      games/ice/ice.junta
