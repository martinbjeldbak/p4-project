This report presents the process of defining, designing, and
implementing the programming language called \productname{}.
\productname{} is a purely functional object-oriented domain-specific
programming language made specifically for programming board games. \\

In the process we have defined, designed, and implemented a scanner,    
parser, scope checker, and an interpreter. Furthermore, we have         
implemented a simulator, which through a game abstraction layer          
communicates with the interpreter and in which it is possible to play    
\productname{} games. \\

All of \productname{}'s components are built on top of Java. This means
that every system with Java virtual machine support also supports
\productname{}. \\
