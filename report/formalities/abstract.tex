This report presents the process of defining, designing and implementing the programming language called
\productname{}. \productname{} is a functional and object oriented programming language made specifically
for programming board games in. 

In the process we have defined, designed and implemented a scanner, a parser, 
a scope checker and an interpreter. Furthermore we have implemented a simulator which through a game 
abstraction layer communicates with the interpreter and in which it's possible to play \productname{} games in. 

All of the \productname{} programming language's modules are programmed in Java. This means that every system 
that supports the Java virtual machine also supports \productname{}.
