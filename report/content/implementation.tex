\chapter{Implementation}
\label{chap:implementation}

In the following chapter we present how the different modules of \productname{} are implemented. In \secref{sec:scannerimplementation} the scanner implementation is specified and examples are given of how the tokens are identified. In \secref{sec:parserimplementation} we present the parser of
\productname{}. We explain how it's constructed and how it works. Furthermore we present a parser and scanner generated by SableCC and the reason why we did not proceed with this approach. In \secref{sec:ant} our abstract node types are explained and illustrated. In \secref{sec:staticsemantics} we present the scope checker of \productname{}. Here the visitor pattern and the use of it is also introduced. In \secref{sec:interpreter} the interpreter is presented. Here we explain how patterns are implemented which is a feature used in most programs written in \productname{} and we introduce our implementation of operators and values. In \secref{sec:errorhandling} we present how error handling is implemented. In \secref{sec:gameabstractionlayer} we explain the game abstraction layer which is the layer that binds the interpreter and the simulator together and makes them able to communicate with each other. Finally in \secref{sec:simulator-impl} the game simulator of \productname{} is presented.
