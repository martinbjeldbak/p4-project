\chapter{Implementation}
\label{chap:implementation}

In the following chapter we present how the different modules of \productname{} are implemented. In \secref{sec:scannerimplementation} the scanner implementation is specified and examples of how the tokens are identified are given. In \secref{sec:parserimplementation} we present the parser of
\productname{}. We explain how it's constructed and how it works. Furthermore we present the implementation of SableCC and the reason why we did not proceed with this. In \secref{sec:ant} our abstract node types are explained and illustrated. In \secref{sec:staticsemantics} we present the scope checker of \productname{}. Here the visitor pattern and the use of it is also introduced. In \secref{sec:interpreter} the interpreter is presented
