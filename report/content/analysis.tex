\chapter{Analysis}
This chapter will present an analysis of 3 common board games. For each board game some general game elements are considered. These are game elements that might be possible to ease the implementation of in a board game specific programming language. The elements are later on summarised to a complete list that respects the elements from the all three games. These elements will serve as requirements used when designing \productname{}. The implementation will be done in a way that favours the end users of \productname{} and eases their use of these functions. Common methods for implementing a programming language will be introduced as well as a discussion of simulators, since a such one will be needed to play \productname{}-games. The topics discussed in this chapter is used for the construction of a detailed list of requirements for \productname{}.
