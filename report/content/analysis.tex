\chapter{Analysis}
This chapter will present an analysis of 3 common board games. For each board game, the important main game mechanisms are considered and later on summarised to a complete list of game mechanisms, from which duplicates will be removed and very similar mechanisms will be rewritten to a single mechanism that meets the requirements of the others. These requirements will be used later for designing \productname{}. Common methods for implementing a programming language will then be introduced as well as a discussion of simulators which will be used for playing the \productname{} games. The topics discussed in this chapter is used for the construction of a detailed list of requirements for \productname{}.
