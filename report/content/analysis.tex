\chapter{Analysis}
\label{chap:analysis}
\todo{Rewrit so it fits the new structure of the analysis chapter}
In the following chapter we analyse some different board games, namely kalah and chess. This is done to gain a better understanding of which elements and components they contain, which will be useful knowledge when designing our programming language. The analysis of the games can be found in \secref{sec:chessandkalah}. Furthermore, we investigate programming paradigms in \secref{sec:paradigms}. We need to know about the existing paradigms to be able to make a good decision, on which paradigm(s) our own language should be based on. In the chapter we also analyse the phases of compilation and interpretation. We give an overview of their phases, which is seen in \secref{sec:compileroverview}, and after that we dig deeper into the details of the parsing phase where we describe what a context free grammar is, in \secref{sec:cfg}, and we look at the advantages and disadvantages of different kind of parsers and different ways of constructing parsers in \secref{sec:parsers}. In the end of the chapter a list of requirements to our programming language is presented together with a problem statements. These are the results of the chapter and will work as the foundation for the further work of the project.
