\chapter{Analysis}
\label{chap:analysis}

This chapter focuses on the preliminary thoughts made before designing
the language. Here research is shown and decisions on basic design
principles are made. In \secref{sec:board-game-analysis} we begin by
defining what a board game actually is in. What is the definition
of it? Afterwards in \secref{sec:chessandkalah} we analyse two
board games, namely Chess and Kalah, to gain a better understanding
of which elements and artefacts they contain. After the analysis
of board games, we begin by analysing the four main programming
paradigms in \secref{sec:paradigms} and how the different paradigms
are used and what they are good for. After this we take a look at
how syntactic analysis is done in \secref{sec:syntacticanalysis}
and which methods we can use to analyse our own syntax. In this
section we for instance look at context-free grammars and different
approaches to parsing and how a parser can be constructed. After
this we look at which contextual constraints context-free grammars
have in \secref{sec:contextualconstraints}. Furthermore, we take a
look at code generation and interpretation of a given source code in
\secref{sec:codegenerationandinterpretation}. Here we investigate the
translation process. We also describe when an intermediate language can
be used and what it is good for. In this section, we also define what a
compiler and an interpreter is. In \secref{sec:simulator} we investigate
and describe how a game simulator can be used to visualise the produced
game in our programming language. Here we also describe which possible
features we can add to make the simulator a good environment for the
user.

This chapter must make it possible for us to make informed
design decisions for our programming language designed in
\chapref{chap:design}. Lastly in \secref{sec:summaryofdecisions},
we present our major decisions which have been made throughout this
chapter.
