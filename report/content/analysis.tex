\chapter{Analysis}
\label{chap:analysis}

In this chapter we begin by defining what a board game actually is in
\secref{sec:board-game-analysis}. What is the definition of it? Afterwards we
analyse two board games, namely kalah and chess, to gain a better understanding
of which elements and components they contain. This is done in
\secref{sec:chessandkalah}.

After the analysis of board games, we begin by analysing programming paradigms
in \secref{sec:paradigms} and how the different paradigms are used and what they
are good for. 

After this we take a look at how syntactic analysis is done in
\secref{sec:syntacticanalysis} and which methods we can use to analyse our own
syntax. In this section we for instance look at context-free grammars in and
different approaches to parsing in and how a parser can be constructed. After
this we look at which contextual constraints context-free grammars have in
\secref{sec:contextualconstraints}.

Furthermore, we take a look at code generation and interpretation of a given
source code in \secref{sec:codegenerationandinterpretation}. Here we investigate
the translation process. We also describe when an intermediate language can be
used and what it is good for. Lastly in this section, we define what a compiler
and an interpreter is.

In \secref{sec:simulator} we investigate and describe how a simulator can be use
to visualise the produced game in our programming language. Here we also
describe which possible features we can add to make the simulator a good
environment for the user.

This chapter must make it possible for us to make informed design decisions for
our programming language. Lastly in \secref{sec:summaryofdecisions}, we present
our major decisions which have been made throughout this chapter.
