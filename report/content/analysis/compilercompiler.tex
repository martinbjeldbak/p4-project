\section{Generating a parser}
The principle of generating parsers is very systematic and therefore there are different automated tools to generate parsers for a specific grammar that meets some standards. A grammar must for instance not be ambiguous otherwise the tools cannot make a distinct parser for the grammar. 

\subsection{Handwritten parser}
Recursive descent parser (LL).

\subsection{Generated parsers}
There are quite a few automated parser generaters (compiler compilers). Theoretically, the only thing the developer must do is input the grammar into the generater, and it will output a parser for that specific grammar.

\subsubsection{SableCC}
Generates a LALR(1) parser.

\subsubsection{JavaCC}
Generates a LL(k) parser.
