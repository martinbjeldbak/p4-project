\subsection{Declaration before use}

%The rule that all variables must be declared before being used is impossible to
%express in a BNF. That would require the BNF to remember things, particularly
%those variables it had seen before, which it cannot. The problem of remembering
%things also shows up when we start to concern about scope rules. Typically, a
%variable declared in one scope cannot be used outside that scope. The BNF cannot
%describe such problems that we describe as static semantics rules. It is named
%static because the analysis required to check the specifications can be done at
%compile-time rather than run-time\cite[p. 153]{sebesta2013}.
