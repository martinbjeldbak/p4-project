\begin{quote}
``The object of the game is to capture more seeds than one's opponent.
At the beginning of the game, three seeds are placed in each house.
Each player controls the six houses and their seeds on his/her side of the board. His/her score is the number of seeds in the store to his/her right.
Players take turns sowing their seeds. On a turn, the player removes all seeds from one of the houses under his/her control. Moving counter-clockwise, the player drops one seed in each house in turn, including the player's own store but not his/her opponent's.
If the last sown seed lands in the player's store, the player gets an additional move. There is no limit on the number of moves a player can make in his/her turn.
If the last sown seed lands in an empty house owned by the player, and the opposite house contains seeds, both the last seed and the opposite seeds are captured and placed into the player's store.
When one player no longer has any seeds in any of his/her houses, the game ends. The other player moves all remaining seeds to his/her store, and the player with the most seeds in his/her store wins.
It is possible for the game to end in a draw, with 18 seeds each.''
