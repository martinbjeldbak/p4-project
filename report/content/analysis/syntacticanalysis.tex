\section{The syntactic translation phase}
\label{sec:syntacticanalysis}

In this section we describe and analyse the phase where a compiler performs
syntatic analysis. The syntatic analysis is performed by the algorithm called a
parser. A parser checks whether or not the source code of a given program is set
up syntactically correct according to the programming language it is written in.
All programming languages have rules for how its tokens can be combined (tokens
are described in \secref{sec:lexicalanalysis}).  A common way to describe these
rules is by using formal language-generation mechanisms called grammars or
context-free grammars. 

Context-free grammers are described in \secref{sec:context-freegrammars}.  There
exists two main approaches to perform syntatic analysis, one is top-down parsing
from which the family of LL(k) parsers derive (the k defines the number of
tokens needed as look ahead). The other is bottom-up parsing from which the
family of LR(k) parser derive.  In \secref{subsec:llparsersandlrparsers} we
analyse how the LL- and LR-parsers work and we look at the advantages and
disadvantages of each by comparing them. Furthermore, we look at different
methods for making parsers, more specifically we analyse the pros and cons
against writing the parser by hand vs. using parser generating tools to generate
a parser, which is presented in \secref{subsec:constructingaparser}.
