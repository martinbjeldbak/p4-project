\section{The syntactic translation phase}
\label{sec:syntacticanalysis}

In this section we describe and analyse the phase where a compiler
performs syntactic analysis. The syntactic analysis is performed
by an algorithm called a parser. A parser checks whether or not
the source code of a given program is set up syntactically correct
according to the programming language it is written in. All programming
languages have rules for how its tokens can be combined, described in
\secref{sec:lexicalanalysis}. A common way to describe these rules
is by using formal language-generation mechanisms called grammars or
context-free grammars, described in\secref{sec:context-freegrammars}).

There exists two main approaches to perform syntactic analysis. One
is top-down parsing from which the family of LL($k$) parsers derive
(the $k$ defines the number of tokens needed as look ahead). The other
is bottom-up parsing from which the family of LR($k$) parsers derive.
In \secref{subsec:llparsersandlrparsers}, we analyse how LL- and
LR-parsers work and we look at the advantages and disadvantages of each
by comparing them. Furthermore, we look at different methods for making
parsers, more specifically we analyse the pros and cons against writing
the parser by hand vs.\ using parser-generating tools to generate a
parser, presented in \secref{subsec:constructingaparser}.
