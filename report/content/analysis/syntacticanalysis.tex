\section{Syntactic analysis}

In the following section we describe and analyse the syntatic analysis phase of compilers. The syntatic analysis is performed by the component or algorithm called a parser. A parser checks whether or not the source code of a given application is set up syntactically correct according to the programming language it is written in. All programming languages have rules for how it's tokens can be combined (we will describe these in \secref{sec:lexicalanalysis}). 
A common way to describe these rules is by a formal language-generation mechanism called grammars or context-free grammars. Context-free grammers are described in this section in \secref{sec:context-freegrammars}. There exists two main approaches to performing syntatic analysis, one is top-down parsing from which the family of LL(k) parsers derives from (the k defines the number of lookahead tokens). The other is bottom-up parsing from which the family of LR(k) parser derives from. In \secref{subsec:llparsersandlrparsers} we analyse how the LL-parsers and LR-parsers work and we look at the advantages and the disadvantages of each by comparing them. Furthermore, we look at different methods for making parsers, more specifically we analyse the pros and cons against writing the parser by hand versus using parser generator tools to generate it, which is in \secref{subsec:constructingaparser}.
