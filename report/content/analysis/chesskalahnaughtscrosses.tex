\section{Chess, Kalah and Naughts \& Crosses}

In the following sections we will analyse the three games: Chess,
Kalah, and Naughts \& Crosses. The reason why we pick these three games is because they are among those we have biggest personal
interest in, and we feel they are essential for a generic board game programming language's possible descriptions of games. Therefore we want to dig
deeper into the details of the components of these games (e.g. the
pieces, the board, the squares, etc.) to gain a better understanding
of which features are needed in \productname. The respective history
and basic rules of the games and other related information will not
be included in the analysis, since this has no relevance for gaining
understanding of how our programming language should be designed.
