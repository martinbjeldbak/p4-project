\section{Chess, Kalah and Naughts \& Crosses}

In the following sections a detailed analysis of the three games: Chess,
Kalah, and Naughts \& Crosses will be performed. The reason why we pick
these three games is because they are among those we have personal
interest in, and feel are essential for a generic board game programming
language's possible descriptions of games. Therefore we want to dig
deeper into the details of the components of these games (e.g. the
pieces, the board, the squares, etc.) to gain a better understanding
of which features are needed in \productname. The respective history
and basic rules of the games and other related information will not
be included in the analysis, since this has no relevance for gaining
understanding of how our programming language should be designed.
