\section{Chess and Kalah}
\label{sec:chessandkalah}

In the following sections we will analyse the two games: Chess and Kalah. The reason for picking these games is because they are among those we have biggest personal interest in, and we think they contain some fundamental board game elements which we need to know about to gain a better understanding of which features are needed in a board game programming language. We are going to focus on the components of the games e.g. the pieces, the board, the squares, etc.
