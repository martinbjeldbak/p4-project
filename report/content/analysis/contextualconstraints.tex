\section{Contextual constraints}
\label{sec:contextualconstraints}

Context-free grammars cannot describe syntax which can only be syntactically
correct given a specific context (hence the name of these grammars). This means
that there are constraints which a given context-free grammar cannot describe.

These contextual constraints are i.e.\cite[pg. 39]{plpp}:

\begin{dlist}
\item Declaration before use
\item Scope rules
\item Type correspondence
\item Overriding methods
\end{dlist}

In the following subsections we eplain why these cannot be described by using a
context-free grammar.

% Semantics at compile-time
