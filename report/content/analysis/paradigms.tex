\section{Paradigms}

A programming paradigm describes a method and style of computer programming.
Some of the primary paradigms are imperative, object-oriented, functional and declarative programming. While some programming languages strictly follow one paradigm, there are many so-called multi-paradigm languages, that implement several paradigms and therfore allow multiple styles of programming. Examples of multi-paradigm languages include C\# and Java.
