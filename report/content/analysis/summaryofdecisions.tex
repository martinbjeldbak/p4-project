\section{Summary of essential decisions}
\label{sec:summaryofdecisions}

Based on this chapter we have made the following decisions, which our
continued work will focus on:

We will craft an LL(1)-parser by hand and generate a LALR(1)-parser with SableCC
which is a parser generator. The reason for this decision is the fact that this
project is ment as a learning experience and therefore knowing how the parsing
phase works is important. By both crafting a parser by hand and by the use of a
generator tool we will get to know how a well-known parser generator works.

We will focus on the functional and object-oriented programming
paradigms. These paradigms make great sense for a programming language that
focus on board game programming which is domain-specific. The reason for this 
is specified in \secref{sec:paradigms}.

We will focus on crafting an intepreter rather than a compiler. This
makes sense especially because we have also decided to make a game simulator.
By having an interpreter rather than a compiler, the game programmer will be
able to make changes in the code and see them visualised in the simulator right
away without having to re-compile the whole program.

The decision of including a simulator is based on the assumption that board game
programmers wish to have their games visualised and quickly be able to play and
test them.

This chapter has set the foundation for a list of requirements for
our programming language, which can be seen in the following
\chapref{chap:requirements}.
