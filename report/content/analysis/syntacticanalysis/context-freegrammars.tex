\subsection{Context-free grammars}
\label{sec:context-freegrammars}

In the previous section, we described how the scanner transforms an input stream
of characters into an output stream of tokens. In the following section we will
describe context-free grammars, a component which contains the programming
languages grammar, that is the set of rules for how its tokens can be combined.

A context-free grammar contains a set of terminals, a set of non-terminals, a
set of productions and a start symbol. The terminals are the tokens from the
lexical analysis. The non-terminals all have a set of productions, from which a
mix of terminals and non-terminals can be derived. A production typically
has the following form:

\begin{ebnf}
\grule{non-terminal} {\{terminal \gor \gcat non-terminal\}}
\end{ebnf}

A start production specifies a single non-terminal, from where all syntactically
valid strings, that are in the language, can be derived by using the
production rules until only a sequence of terminals (the tokens) are left. The
syntax analysis takes a sequence of tokens as input and tries to create a set of
derivations from the start symbol that creates the given sequence of tokens. If
successful, the input has been parsed and the parse tree is kept for later
analysis. The parse tree is the information concerning how the start symbol was
derived into the sequence of tokens, which yields a tree structure. This tree
is called an abstract syntax tree.
