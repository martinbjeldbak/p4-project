\subsection{LL-parsers and LR-parsers}
\label{subsec:llparsersandlrparsers}
As mentioned in the itroduction to the section, the LL-parsers derives from the top-down parsing approach.
In terms of grammars, this means the LL-parsers attempts to parse a string by starting at the start symbol of 
the grammar and through a series of leftmost derivations match the
input string. On the opposite the LR-parsers derives from the bottom-up parsing
approach. Here the LR-parsers attempts to parse by starting with the input
string and through a series of reductions get back to the start symbol.
The LL-parsers has two actions: predict and match. The predict action is used
when the parser is trying to guess the next production to apply in order to get
closer to the input string. While the match action eats the next unconsumed
input symbol if it corresponds to the leftmost predicted terminal. These two
actions are continuously called until the entire input string has been eaten and
thereby has been matched. An example of a LL(1) parser in action can be seen in
table \ref{table:LL1}. In the example the parser is based on the simple grammar: 

\begin{centering}
\begin{ebnf}
	\grule{S}{E}
	\grule{E}{T \gcat + \gcat E}
	\galt{T}
	\grule{T}{int}
\end{ebnf}
\end{centering}

{Step  	 }{Production & Input       & Action                        }{
\tabrow{1}{$S$        & $int + int$ & Predict $S \rightarrow E$     }
\tabrow{2}{$E$	      & $int + int$ & Predict $E \rightarrow T + E$ }
\tabrow{3}{$T+E$      & $int + int$ & Predict $T \rightarrow int$   }
\tabrow{4}{$int+E$    & $int + int$ & Match $int$  		    }
\tabrow{5}{$+E$       & $+ int$     & Match $+$		    	    }
\tabrow{6}{$E$ 	      & $int$ 	    & Predict $E \rightarrow T$     }
\tabrow{7}{$T$ 	      & $int$ 	    & Predict $T \rightarrow int$   }
\tabrow{8}{$int$      & $int$       & Match $int$   		    }
\tabrow{ }{           &             & Accept			    }
}

S, E and T are non-terminals and ``+'' and int are terminals. 
The LR-parsers also has two actions: the shift action and the reduce action. The
shift action adds the next input symbol of the input string into a buffer for
consideration. The reduce action reduces a collection of nonterminals and
terminals into a nonterminal by reversing a production. These two actions are
continuously called until the input string is reduced to the start symbol.
\cite{LL(1)andLR(2)inaction}. An example of a LR(2)-parser in action is
illustrated in table \ref{table:LR2}.

\tabrow{8}{$E$        &             & Reduce $S \rightarrow E$   }
\tabrow{ }{$S$        &             & Accept			 }

\subsubsection{Comparison of the parsers}
Compared to the LL-parsers the LR-parsers are more complex and they are generally harder
to construct \cite[pp. 193]{sebesta2013}, thus by the use of automated generator tools this
might not be the case, but we will save the analysis of how to construct a parser to the up-coming section.  
The LR-parsers are more powerful than the LL-parsers, because they accept a bigger variety of grammars. 
For instance LL-parsers can't handle grammars with left-recursion,
while LR-parsers can. The ``power'' and complexity of a parser is very dependent on the number of lookahead tokens, $k$,
the parser makes use of. The bigger k is, the more complex and difficult the parsers is to contruct, but the bigger variety of
grammars the parser also accepts. As illustrated in \figref{fig:LL-parserandLR-parser} the LL parser is a proper subset of the LR parsers.
The figure is taken from slides in the ``language and compiler'' course.

by different parsers. As illustrated LR(k)-parsers are supersets of
