\subsection{Chess}
Chess is a board game of two opposing players. Chess is a turn-based game played
on a board of $8 \times 8$ squares. The squares are typically black and white,
but can be any two colors (see figure \ref{fig:chess}). The squares can only
contain one piece at a time, unlike other games e.g. Kalah and Backgammon. 

Each player has a total of 16 pieces: 8 pawns, 2 knights, 2 bishops, 2 rooks, 1
queen and 1 king. Each piece type has unique possible moves. For instance a pawn
can move only one square vertically forward or one square diagonal when
capturing an enemy piece. A rook can move unlimited squares either vertically or
horisontally. The fact that each piece type has a unique way to move separates
chess from a lot of other common board games where all pieces have the same
abilities, like Naughts and Crosses, Kalah, Ludo, Backgammon. This means it
should be possible to define a unique movement pattern for numerus different
types of pieces in \productname{}. 

Cut to the bone, Chess goes as follow: When a game starts the pieces are in their
starting positions as seen in figure \ref{fig:chess}. The player with the white
pieces always makes the first move and after that the players take turn in
which clever moves are being made and pieces are being captured until one
player has checkmated the other - and the game is over. The checkmate condition
is obtained when the king piece is in a position to be captured and cannot
escape from capture in the next move. \cite{chessrules} Therefore it should be
possible to look one move ahead to control if the checkmate condition is
obtained.

\subsubsection{Special moves} 
In chess there are numerus special moves which doesn't follow the normal pattern
of movements in chess. Earlier we mentioned that a pawn can move only one square
vertically forward or one square diagonal when capturing an enemy piece. But
this is not always true. If the pawn is in its respective starting position it
can move either one or two squares vertically forward. After that it can only
move one square forward or one square vertically the rest of the game. 

Another special move is the move called ``castling''. This move allows a player
to move two pieces in one turn (the king and one of the rooks). But to do the
move several conditions must be met. First; the move has to be the very first
move of the king and the rook, second; there can't be any pieces standing
between the king and the rook, and third; there can't be any opposing pieces
that could capture the king in his original square, the squares he moves through
or the square he ends up in.
\cite{chessrules} 

There exits two more special moves which are called ''En Passant´´ and
''Promotion´´. These are not going to be described here, but information about
them can be found in \cite{chessrules}. 

So what is the problem with these special moves? The problem is the fact that
they don't follow the regular pattern of the game and this has to be taken into
consideration when designing \productname{}.

From the above analysis we present this list of interesting game elements we found 
in chess:

\begin{dlist}
\item Pieces have different movement abilities.
\item A squared board with a number of squares in it.
\item A winning condition - when the king has been checkmated.
\item A starting state - how the pieces are placed on the board before the
  game's very first move.
\item Special moves like ``Castling'', ``Promotion'', and ``En Passant''.
\item Constraints that disallow a piece to move if some condition is true after
  the move has been made (a move that sets your king in check).
\item A piece can be ``captured'' by another piece, which causes the piece to be
  removed from the board.
\end{dlist}
