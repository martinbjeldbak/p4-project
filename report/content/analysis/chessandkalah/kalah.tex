\subsection{Kalah}

Kalah is like chess, a turn-based game consisting of two opposing
players. But Kalah pieces, called seeds, are very different from the
Chess pieces. They do not have specific moves but rather functions,
as their name also suggest, as seeds. The board is not like the Chess
board either. It consists of $14$ squares, sometimes referred to as houses
\cite{kalahrules}, with two of the houses separating themselves from the
rest by being the houses or bases of each of the players. Furthermore,
each player has six houses belonging to them (see \figref{fig:kalah}).
Each house (including the players' houses) can contain an arbitrary
number of seeds, unlike in chess where the squares can only contain one
piece.

Cut to the bone, Kalah goes as follows: When the game starts, each
of the $12$ houses contain $4$ seeds (in some versions of the game
each house contains $5$ or $6$ seeds), and the player bases are empty.
Now the players take turn to pick up piles of seeds and deal them out
to the $12$ houses, including their own base. The dealing of seeds
works by a player picking up a pile of seeds from one of his six houses
and dropping one seed down in each of the following houses, moving
counter-clockwise. If, when dealing out seeds, he lands in a house
belonging to himself (not including his own base), that is not empty
and does not belong to the opponent, the player can pick up the pile of
seeds in the house and start dealing these out. A player's turn ends
if, when dealing out seeds, he lands in an empty house or one of the
opponent's houses. For a more detailed description of the rules, we
refer to \cite{kalahrules}. The game is over once one of the players'
six houses is empty and the winner player with most seeds in their base.

\subsubsection{Special moves}
Like in Chess there are some special moves in Kalah that don't follow the
regular pattern of the Kalah game. We are not going to describe them here, but
they will be present in the list of interesting game elements and can be found
in a detailed description in \cite{kalahrules}.

Here is a list of some interesting game elements we found in Kalah. For
simplicity we are going to refer to houses and bases as squares and refer to
seeds as pieces:

\begin{dlist}
  \item Squares can contain an arbitrary number of pieces
  \item Making a move can be considered as simple as choosing a square
  \item The number of pieces on a square determines how long a move you can make
  \item A turn may contain more than one move
    \begin{dlist}
      \item If the last piece is dropped in a non-empty square, the player can
	make another move
    \end{dlist}
  \item A square can belong to a player
  \item Squares can be related to other squares
    \begin{dlist}
      \item You place pieces on squares counter-clockwise
      \item If you place the last piece on an empty square, the square across
	the board belonging to the opponent is emptied over to your own square
    \end{dlist}
  \item An end game condition - when all of the squares belonging to a player are
    empty
  \item A winning condition - the player with the most pieces in their square
    wins when the end game condition has been met
  \item Only one type of piece
\end{dlist}
