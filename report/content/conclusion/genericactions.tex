\subsection{Stronger action system}
\label{sec:strongeractionsystem}

The actions provide everything needed for working with pieces, however when new artifacts are added actions which affects those are needed. An actions to take a card from a deck, an action to play a card, etc. Some artifacts could be generalized: a card could be a \type{Piece} and a deck could be a \type{Square} where the order of multiple pieces is given significance. Generalizing should be done with care though, over-generalizing will be counter productive with the idea of using a domain specific language. However if cards were pieces, new action types would not need to be created and learned by the user.

Instead of generalizing the artifacts, we could generalize actions. For example, instead of \type{AddAction} adding a \type{Piece}, \type{AddAction} could add any type and \type{MoveAction} could move both pieces and cards. However now \type{MoveAction} can depend on an \type{AddAction} having created an instance of a type, which is not expressed well in \type{ActionSequence}.
