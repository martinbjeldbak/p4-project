\subsection{More actions}
\label{sec:moreactions}

The actions provide everything needed for working with pieces, however when new artifacts are added actions which affects those are needed. An actions to take a card from a deck, an action to play a card, etc. Some artifacts could be generalized: a card could be a \type{Piece} and a deck could be a \type{Square} where the order of multiple pieces is given significance. It is a tradeoff however; generalising will make learning the entire interface easier, but it can make it harder to use
