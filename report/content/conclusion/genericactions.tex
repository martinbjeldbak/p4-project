\subsection{Stronger action system}
\label{sec:strongeractionsystem}

The actions provide everything needed for working with pieces, however when new
artifacts are added actions which affects those are needed. An action to take a
card from a deck, an action to play a card, etc. Some artifacts could be
generalised: a card could be a \type{Piece} and a deck could be a \type{Square}
where the order of multiple pieces is given significance. Generalising should be
done with care though, over-generalising will be counter productive with the
idea of using a domain-specific language. However, if cards were pieces, new
action types would not need to be created and learned by the user.

Instead of generalising the artifacts, we could generalise actions. For example,
instead of \type{AddAction} adding a \type{Piece}, \type{AddAction} could add
any type and \type{MoveAction} could move both pieces and cards. However, now
\type{MoveAction} can depend on an \type{AddAction} having created an instance
of a type, which is not expressed well in \type{ActionSequence}.
