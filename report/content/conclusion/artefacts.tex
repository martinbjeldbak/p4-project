\subsection{Artefacts}
\label{sec:artefacts}

In \productname{}, the type of games that can be implemented are limited by the fact that randomness is not supported. 
A game like minesweeper cannot be implemented with randomly generated levels. The board game monopoly would need randomness 
to implement a good die. A random card cannot be drawn and a deck of card cannot be shuffled. In our game environment described in \secref{sec:gameenvironment} many board game related types, constants and functions are implemented. Here it would be natural to also include types like
a die type, a card type, and a type that can generate random numbers. If the random type would generate random numbers based on a seed, some kind of system time constant should also be available in \productname{}. Another approach would be to automatically seed the random type based on a system time constant every time a game is loaded.
