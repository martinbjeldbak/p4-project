\subsection{Random values}
\label{sec:artefacts}

In \productname{}, the type of games that can be implemented are limited
by the fact that randomness is not supported. A game like minesweeper
cannot be implemented with randomly generated levels. The board game
monopoly would need randomness to implement a good die. A random card
cannot be drawn, and a deck of card cannot be shuffled. In our game
environment, described in \secref{sec:gameenvironment}, many board game
related types are described, such as constants and functions. Here it
would be natural to also include types like a die type, a card type,
and most importantly, a type that can generate random numbers. If the
random type would generate random numbers based on a seed, some kind
of system time constant should also be available in \productname{}.
Another approach would be to automatically seed the random type based on
a system time constant every time a game is loaded.

Randomness is not implemented in \productname{} because it is not a
functional language trait, since the function wouldn't always return the
same value. Hence an implementation with seeding described above could
be a possible solution.
