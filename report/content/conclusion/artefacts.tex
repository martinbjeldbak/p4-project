\subsection{Artefacts}
\label{sec:artefacts}

In \productname{} games it is not possible to have dice, cards or similar artefacts due to the 
fact that random number generation is not supported. This is a big limitation which decreases the
amount of games possible to program in \productname{} significantly. A game like snake
where a kind of food shows up at random locations on the board or monopoly where a dice decides how
far a player can move and play cards add unforeseen surprises are examples of games which are not possible 
to create. In our game environment described in \secref{sec:gameenvironment} 
many board game related types, constants and functions are implemented. Here it would be natural to also include a
dice type and a card type and related constants like number of eyes on the dice etc.
