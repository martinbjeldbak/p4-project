\subsection{Compile to intermediate language, then translate further}
\label{sec:compiletointermediate}

In this project we decided to implement an interpreter for our programming
language. This decision was made on the basis of our analysis chapter
(\chapref{chap:analysis}), but it is possible to develop a compiler instead. In
this section we will explain what we should have done differently in terms of
the translation method. In \secref{sec:codegenerationandinterpretation} in the
analysis chapter we have analysed and discussed the differences between these
translation methods.
