\subsection{Board types}
\label{sec:boardtypes}

The game environment of \productname{} makes it easy for programmers to create grid boards, which is a
very basic kind of board defined by a width and a height. But what if the programmer wanted to create a
circular kind of square or a hexagonal square? This is currently not possible but it would be practical 
in a future version of \productname{}. A possible solution would be a graphical representation of the board where
the edges represent squares and transitions represent the border between squares.
