\subsection{Board types}
\label{sec:boardtypes}

The game environment of \productname{} makes it easy for programmers
to create grid-shaped boards, which is a very basic kind of board
defined by a width and a height filled in with squares. But what if the
programmer wanted to create a circular kind of square or a hexagonal
square? This is currently not possible, but it would be practical in
a future version of \productname{}. A possible solution would be a
graph representation of the board, where the edges represent squares
and transitions represent the border between squares. This would
allow greater expressibility and technically allowing every kind of
imagionable board, even those expanding over time, such as Carcassone.

Patterns, as they are implemented now, only work on grid-shaped boards
because programmers can't define custom \type{Direction} types. To
support all kinds of boards, patterns would have to be able to support
these custom \type{Direction} types. \type{Direction}s would have to be
rewritten so that it'd be possible to define how a certain square is
relative to another (i.e.\ the \type{Direction} would be the label on
an edge going from one square to another).
