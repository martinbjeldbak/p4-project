\section{Error handling}

In all of the different phases of the interpreter lots of errors can occur. In the scanning phase
a scanning error can occur if the scanner detects a string, which doesn't correspond to one of our language's specified tokens.
This is a lexical error, but we refer to it as a scanning error. In the parsing phase a syntax error can occur if two or more
tokens are not set up syntactically correct according to our grammar. We have created an error hierarchy in order to give an
overview of our different errors, which is illustrated in 

    
% Talk about how, where, and why errors are thrown in the different packages
% ..and how they're implemented
