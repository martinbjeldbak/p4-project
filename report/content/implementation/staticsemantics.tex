\section{Static semantics}
The \classref{ScopeChecker} is a class that uses a number of other classes to check the static semantic rules of \productname{} at compile-time. This section is aimed to explain how these static semantic checks are performed by the \classref{ScopeChecker} in simple steps. The different checks it does is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item A type cannot extend itself
\item A type cannot extend a type that is not defined except if it is in the standard environment
\item A type cannot extend a type if it causes an extend cycle
\item When a type extends another type, it must call the constructor of the extended type with the right number of arguments
\item If a type contains at least one abstract member, its AstNode's type (TypeDef) must be changed to AbstractTypeDef
\item  
\end{itemize}
