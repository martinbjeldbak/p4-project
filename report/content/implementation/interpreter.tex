\section{Interpreter}
The final step is the interpretation of the AST generated by the parser.
Here choices are taken based on the different node types in the tree
for a given program. This interpreter class is, like the scope checker,
also implemented with the visitor pattern, visiting all the nodes and
taking appropriate actions depending on what type of node is visited.
The difference here is that values, types, and other language constructs
are created and evaluated directly, propagating the values up the AST.

In this section, we will look at the inner workings of the interpreter and
