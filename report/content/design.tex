\productname{} is a purely functional programming language designed for creating
board games.
\todo{More introduction}

\subsection*{Code sample}

We have developed \productname{} by first brainstorming and writing a bunch of
game implementations using a ``programming language'' which felt the most
natural to us. By this we mean that we were actually using the programming
language before we had even constructed it. We began by writing programs in the
unfinished language to try to find out how it should be built and what would be
the easiest to write. The following is a result of this and it is an example of an
implementation of the board game Noughts and Crosses:

\codesample{noughtandcrosses.game}

\todo{Describe exactly what this example does}

Based on our implementations, we first define the formal grammar of
\productname{} in \secref{sec:grammar}. Afterwards, the contextual constraints
are informally described  in xxx. Furthermore, we describe the\dots in xxx. Lastly, the 
\ldots are described in xxx.
