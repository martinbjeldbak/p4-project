\section{Code example - Naughts and Crosses}

We have developped \productname{} by first brainstorming and writing a bunch of game implementations
using a ``programming language'' which felt the most natural to us. The following is a result of this 
and it's an example of an implementation of the board game Noughts and Crosses:

\codesample{noughtandcrosses.game}

Based on our implementations, we first define the formal grammar of
\productname{}. Then the contextual constraints are informally described and 
lastly, the formal semantics are described.
