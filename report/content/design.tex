%should be possible to construct the language by reading this design document..

Since the dawn of time, programming languages have been developped far and wide.

We have developped \productname{} by first writing a bunch of implementations
using it. E.g. the following is an implementation of the board game Noughts
and Corsses:

\codesample{noughtandcrosses.game}

Based on our implementations, we first define the formal grammar of \productname{}.
THen the contextual constraints are informally described. And lastly the formal
semantics are described.
