%should be possible to construct the language by reading this design document..

Since the dawn of time, programming languages have been developped far and wide.

We have developped \productname{} by first writing a bunch of implementations
using the young programming language. E.g. the following is an implementation of
the board game Noughts and Crosses:

\codesample{noughtandcrosses.game}

Based on our implementations, we first define the formal grammar of
\productname{}. Then the contextual constraints are informally described.
Lastly, the formal semantics are described.
