\section{Requirements evaluation}
\label{sec:requirementsevaluation}

In \chapref{chap:requirements} we formulated a series of requirements. The chapter featured requirements for the functionality and performance of \productname{} and also requirements for the final solution. In the following section we will evaluate the requirements we find the most interesting, since going through every single requirement would be uninteresting. 

\begin{description}
\item[\textbf{Requirement 1.a:}]
One of the major requirements of the project is requirement 1.a: ``It must be possible to implement Chess, including the special rules of Chess''. This however has not been possible to do due to time pressure. The special rules of Chess and especially the \emph{En Passant} and \emph{Castling} moves proves to be difficult challenges which requires a good amount of time to get implemented though we believe that \productname{} provides the features to get it done.

\item[\textbf{Requirement 2-5:}]
Are all accomplished

\item[\textbf{Requirement 6:}]
Are all accomplished. Requirement 6.j: ``Check if the current move about to be made for a piece is the first move made by that piece'' is not directly implemented but can be accomplished by for example using a counter, \variable{Moves}, which counts one up for every move taken by the piece and checking if this is bigger than one.

\item[\textbf{Requirement 7-10:}]
Are all accomplished
