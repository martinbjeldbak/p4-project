\section{Requirements evaluation}
\label{sec:requirementsevaluation}

In \chap{chap:requirements} we formulated a series of requirements. The chapter featured requirements for the functionality and performance of \productname{} and also requirements for the final solution. In the following section we will evaluate the requirements we find the most interesting, since going through every single requirement would be uninteresting. 

One of the major requirements of the project is requirement 1.a: ``It must be possible to implement Chess, including the special rules of Chess''. This however has not been possible to do due to time pressure. The special rules of Chess is definitely a challenge which requires a good amount of time to implement but we believe that \productname{} provides the features to get it done.
