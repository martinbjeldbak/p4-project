\section{Structural operational semantics}
\label{sec:structuraloperationalsemantics}

In the following subsections we will describe how programs, written in
\productname{}, behave. We begin by defining the abstract syntax for our
language which consists of a list of different syntactic categories followed by
formulation rules. When these have been presented we can move on to the
description of our operational semantics which is our big-step
semantics.\cite[pg. 27]{tt-hh}
