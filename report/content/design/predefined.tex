\section{Predefined types and constants}
\label{sec:predefined}

In order to write programs in a programming language, it is often neccessary to use a number of built-in
functions and types. \productname{} provides a number of built-in functions and constants, as well as 
a number of simple types for representing values such as integers and strings. \productname{} also provides
a type-hierachy designed for implementing and expressing board games.

Since \productname{} doesn't have a module, package or namespace system, the distinction between a standard-
and game environment doesn't actually exist in the language, and all types and constants exist in the same
global namespace.

\subsection{Standard environment}

The standard environment of \productname{} provides the simple types, and related methods, functions and
constants for working with the simple types.

The following global constants are available:

\begin{dlist}
  \item \texttt{typeOf[\varref{value} : \opstar] : Type}\\
    Return the type of any value.
  \item \texttt{union[\varref{list} : List, ... \varref{lists} : List] : Type}\\
    Return the union of a number of lists.
  \item \texttt{true : Boolean}\\
    The boolean true value.
  \item \texttt{false : Boolean}\\
    The boolean false value.
\end{dlist}

\subsection{Game environment}

The game environment provides a class hierachy for describing a board game in an object-oriented manner.
