\section{Types}

The language should have support for the following types:

\begin{description}[noitemsep]
\item[Integer] a 32-bit signed integer.
\item[String] a UTF-8 encoded string.
\item[Direction] a directional value.
\item[Coordinate] a 2-dimensional vector consisting of an $x$-integer value and
a $y$-integer value, representing a position in a grid.
\item[Function] a function pointer (could be anonoymous, e.g. lambda expression).
\item[List] a list of value (can be empty).
\end{description}

Dynamic typing.
