\section{Types}
\label{sec:types}

The language should have support for the following types:

\begin{description}
\item[Integer] a 32-bit signed integer.
\item[String] a UTF-8 encoded string.
\item[Direction] a directional value.
\item[Coordinate] a 2-dimensional vector consisting of an $x$-integer value and
a $y$-integer value, representing a position in a grid.
\item[Function] a function reference (could be anonoymous, e.g. lambda expression).
\item[Pattern] a pattern used for matching patterns on the board.
\item[List] a list of values (can be empty).
\item[Action]
\end{description}

There is no $null$-type or $null$-value, since all expressions must have a value. This
is also evident in the definition of the $if$-expression in \secref{sec:grammar}, in that
all $if$-expressions must have the $else$-branch.

Dynamic typing.
