\section{Functions}

Functions are a big part of \productname, and are required for most calculations and operations.

In \productname functions are first-class citizens, meaning that functions are treated
as any other value in the language. Therefore one can pass functions as
arguments to other functions or returning them as values. It is also possible to create
anonymous functions (using lambda expressions), and pass these to functions.

\subsection{Standard environment}

Many functions are made available to the programmer in \productname.

\subsection{User-defined functions}

A user can define custom functions for use in the implementation of a board game.
This is done using the $define$-keyword. Functions can be declared to accept
any number of parameters or none at all. An example of a function definition could
be:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=]
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
  html
  </body>
</html>
\end{lstlisting}
