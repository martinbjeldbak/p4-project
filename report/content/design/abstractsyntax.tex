\section{Abstract syntax}

The abstract syntax is the interpreter or compiler's internal representation of a program. It is represented
as an abstract syntax tree.

This section should cover all aspects of our abstract syntax tree, and how it differs from the
parse tree (e.g. there are no expressions or elements in the AST).
