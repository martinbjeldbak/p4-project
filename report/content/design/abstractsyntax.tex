\section{Abstract syntax}

The abstract syntax is the interpreter's or compiler's internal representation of a program. It is represented as an abstract syntax tree which is a series of nodes and leaves connected forming a so-called tree.

This section covers all aspects of our abstract syntax tree (AST), \todo{and how it differs from the parse tree(?)}. When a piece of code is parsed by a parser that understands the specific programming language, the output of the parser will be a parse tree which corresponds to the abstract syntax of each program part. Each program part is represented with an abstract syntax tree within its respective subsection within this section.

\subsection{Program}
Every program written in \productname{} begins with an abstraction which we call ``program'' that consists of either zero or more function definitions followed by a single game decleration. The production for this rule is a follows:

\begin{ebnf}
\grule{program}{\grep{function\_def} \gcat game\_decl}
\end{ebnf}

It is from this production each and every program is derived from. The AST for this abstraction is illustrated in \figref{ast:program}.
