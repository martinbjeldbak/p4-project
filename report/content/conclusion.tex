\todo{ADDITIONAL POINTS:}

multiple inheritance?

more generic action system.. allow for points etc.

more generic board system.. allow for all shapes and sizes; transitions instead
of directions

faster patterns (check only reversed patterns for the piece a player wants to move)

other performance improvements
