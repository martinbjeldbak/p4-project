\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chap:conclusion}

The goal of the project was to define, design, and implement a programming
language.  We have accomplished this goal with the creation of \productname{} --
a functional object-oriented programming language in which it is possible to
program board games. In the process we have defined, designed, and implemented
a scanner, a parser, a scope checker, and an interpreter. Furthermore, we have
implemented a simulator which through a game abstraction layer communicates with
the interpreter and in which it is possible to visualise and play
\productname{} games in.

In the analysis chapter (\chapref{chap:analysis}), we have accounted for
different techniques for constructing compilers and interpreters and further
analysed the phases they consist of. In the design chapter
(\chapref{chap:design}) and the implementation chapter
(\chapref{chap:implementation}), we have documented formally and informally how
we have designed, defined, and implemented \productname{}.

In \chapref{chap:requirements} we formulated a list of requirements which
\productname{} and the final solution should be able to fulfil. In
\secref{sec:requirementsevaluation} we evaluated the requirements and the vast
majority of them has been fulfilled. Unfortunately, it was not possible to
implement Chess due to the special rules of the game. The ``En Passant''
and ``Castling'' moves turned out to be more difficult to implement than we
had expected. Although, we still believe that \productname{} provides the
features necessary to get them implemented.

Several well-known board games has already been programmed in \productname{} e.g. Noughts and
Crosses and Connect Four. The games were created in $19$ lines of code and $22$ lines of code respectively (including cosmetic line breaks). We think this clearly shows that it is possible to program board games in \productname{} using only few lines of code.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

In this section we will discuss what we could have done differently throughout
the project and also discuss future expansion possibilities for \productname{}.
