\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chap:conclusion}

In this chapter, we draw concluding thoughts on fulfilling the
curriculum for this project, and we also verify or falsify the
requirements described in \chapref{chap:requirements}.

We have accomplished the goal of formally implementing a programming
language in which it is possible to program board games. The programming
language is called \productname{}. Our implementation includes an
interpreter instead of a compiler, which would merely have resulted in a
different chapter on implementation.

We have respected the goals of the curriculum throughout the
report. In the analysis chapter (\chapref{chap:analysis}), we
have for instance accounted for different techniques and phases behind the
construction of compilation and interpretation. In the design
chapter (\chapref{chap:design}) and the implementation chapter
(\chapref{chap:implementation}), we have documented formally and
informally how we have designed, defined, and implemented a programming
language.

At a relatively early stage, we concluded that we needed a simulator
in which the games written in \productname{} could be visualised in
and played. This decision was based upon the conclusion that it would
be very awkward to play a game in a console window. We constructed a
game simulator which is presented in \secref{sec:simulator}. We also
implemented an application programming interface other simulator-like
programs can take advantage of.

We have unfortunately not accomplished all the requirements (chapter
\chapref{chap:requirements} we set for this project. We did not
accomplish requirement $1$a. This was due to special rules of Chess.
The \textit{En Passant} and \textit{Castling} moves, which proved to be more
difficult to implement than we expected. Although, we still believe that
\productname{} provides the features necessary to implement them.

Based on the games we have programmed in \productname{} (Noughts and
Crosses and Connect Four), which were possible to create in around $20$
lines of code, we conclude that we have accomplished, where a similar
language uses almost double as many lines for the same implementation.

% This paragraph is about writability?
The speed in which a game can be created in \productname{} depends on a number
of parameters. First of all, the programmers familiarity with the programming
language and the programmer's experience with programming overall. Also the
programming language's support for relevant functionality and its overall
writability is an important parameter. The fact that we were able to create a
fully functional Connect Four game in $5$ minutes can be considered as a quick
implementation and witnesses that it is easy to develop board games in
\productname{}.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

In this section we will discuss what we could have done differently throughout
the project. For instance, we will take a look at what we could have done
instead of developing an interpreter for \productname{}.
