\todo{ADDITIONAL POINTS:}

multiple inheritance?

more generic action system.. allow for points etc.

handling of generic actions in simulator?

more generic board system.. allow for all shapes and sizes; transitions instead
of directions

other performance improvements

use of "layouts" instead of container-widgets
