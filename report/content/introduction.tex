Board games have been played throughout almost all of history, within different cultures, societies, and countries. Backgammon is known to be at least 5,000 years old, and is still played today. Board games can consist of a board, some player pieces or tokens, a  deck of cards, and/or dice. The given player or players follow a set of rules in an attempt to achieve a goal. Strategy and luck are usually involved in some form so playing the game more than once is engaging and dynamic. Most board games only involve one winner at the end of the game.

Different categories exist and board games can be fit into different genres, such as: strategy, alignment, chess variants, paper-and-pencil, territory, race, trivia, wargames, word games, and dozens of others. Obviously some games can overlap genres. Chess is an example of this. It is obviously a chess variant and is very strategy-heavy.
