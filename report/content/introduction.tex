\chapter{A new programming language}
\label{chap:introduction}

So, are we really going to create a new programming language? At this very
moment, hundreds maybe thousands of new programming languages are being created.
A Wikipedia article about current programming languages that exist currently
contains a list of more than $660$ different programming languages\cite{listofprogramminglanguages}, and a lot more languages exists, since this
is only a list of the more well-known languages. So, why is yet another
programming language needed when so many other programming languages
already exist, and when programming languages like Java, \CS{}, and other general purpose
programming languages basically make it possible to program anything one would
like? The answer lies within the powers of domain-specific programming languages
-- a language designed to express solutions to problems in a specific
domain\cite{domainspecificprogramminglanguagedefinition}.

What we intend to do in this project is develop a programming language that can
describe board games. That is designing, defining, and implementing it. We
choose to develop a programming language for the domain in which the programming
of board games lies, because of our personal interest in board games.
Board games are first of all fun and entertaining. They can also be rich on
learning opportunities\cite{whyboardgames1?} and they can give a certain
satisfaction\cite{whyboardgames2?}. In fact, board games can be almost anything
as long as the creator of the game has the right amount of creativity and the
building blocks needed to create the game. These are some of the reasons why it
would be practical with a programming language that makes it easy to program
board games. Yes, it is possible to program board games in Java, \CS{}, and 
other general-purpose programming languages, but is it easy? Definitely not as
easy as in a well crafted programming language specifically designed to program
board games in. If a language purely concentrates on allowing the programmers to
use it to express how the game works, without having to reimplement everything
from scratch as he would in a general purpose programming language, it would be
quicker and easier to develop shorter and more precise programs.  

Furthermore, data structures and special statements specifically
designed to help define board games would greatly increase the
readability and writability of such a program. This can obviously
done with game libraries, but these libraries adapt to the underlying
language's data structures, which has implications of its own. A
language designed with board games in mind would allow the programmers
to, relatively quickly, explore new ideas for a board game with a simple
implementation. The programmer could then efficiently modify the code
according to a new rule or idea that suddenly came up, without having
to make major changes. If the language also took multiple platforms
into account, it would open up the possibility to run the same game
across multiple devices. So there are definitely many advantages of
creating a new domain-specific programming language. Now the question
is, how to develop a new domain-specific programming language in which
one can program board games? We must engage in some research
about board games and the elements and components they consist of and we
will need to analyse the tools and techniques necessary to implement a
compiler. This is included in \chapref{chap:analysis}.
