For this project we've been working with developing a programming language that can be used to describe board games. The specific topic is to design, define, and implement a programing language for generic game playing. This means that we must analyse board games and try to outline which aspects of board games our language must be able to describe. These are aspects like how many players can play? What is the board size? Turns? Possible actions? Winning condition?
