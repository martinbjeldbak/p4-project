\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{chap:evaluation}
This chapter aims to review the different aspects of the design and
implementation of our programming language. Here we look at how easy
writing games is and if they can compete with the same games written
in other languages in \secref{sec:writinggames}. Hereafter our simple
unit testing framework implemented in \productname{} is described
in \secref{sec:unittesting}. Lastly, the interesting and important
requirements listed in \chapref{chap:requirements} are assessed, to see
how many we fulfill and which we haven't seen completed in the final
implementation of \productname{}.
